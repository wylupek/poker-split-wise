# Poker Split-Wise

> **⚠️ Note: This entire repository and all its code was generated by AI.**

A Splitwise-style settlement system for home poker games. Track poker sessions, manage player balances, and calculate minimal settlements.

## Features

- **Player Management**: Add and manage players with persistent balances
- **Session Tracking**: Start poker sessions with customizable chip values and conversion rates
- **Real-time Balance Updates**: See how chip changes convert to real money during sessions
- **Smart Settlements**: Calculate the minimum number of transactions needed to settle all balances (like Splitwise)
- **Session History**: View and manage past poker sessions
- **Local SQLite Database**: All data stored locally in your browser using SQLite (safe and secure)

## How It Works

1. **Players Start Equal**: Every session begins with all players receiving the same number of chips
2. **Chips = Temporary Currency**: Chips only matter during a game session
3. **Conversion to Money**: At session end, chip differences are converted to real money using a fixed rate
4. **Balances Accumulate**: Player balances persist across sessions
5. **Smart Settlement**: The system calculates the minimal set of payments to zero out all balances

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

### Quick Start (Background Mode)

Use the provided scripts to run the app in the background:

```bash
# Start the app (runs in background)
./start.sh

# Stop the app
./stop.sh
```

The scripts will:
- Run silently in the background (no terminal required)
- Show desktop notifications for status updates
- Log all output to `app-control.log`, `backend.log`, and `frontend.log`
- Safely manage processes (won't kill your browser)
- Display the network URL for accessing from other devices

**View logs:**
```bash
tail -f app-control.log   # Start/stop operations
tail -f backend.log        # Backend server output
tail -f frontend.log       # Frontend server output
```

### Development (Interactive Mode)

```bash
# Run both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Frontend** at `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend API** at `http://localhost:3001/api`
- **Database** auto-created at `./data/poker-splitwise.db`

### Running Separately

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend server
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev:client
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

### 1. Add Players

Go to the **Players** tab and add all players who will participate in your poker games.

### 2. Start a Session

- Navigate to the **New Session** tab
- Set the starting chips (same for all players)
- Set the conversion rate (e.g., 0.01 means 1 chip = $0.01)
- Select at least 2 players
- Click **Start Session**

### 3. Track the Game

During the game, update each player's final chip count. The app will automatically calculate:
- Chip difference from starting amount
- Real money equivalent

### 4. Complete the Session

When the game ends, click **Complete Session**. Player balances will be automatically updated.

### 5. View Balances

The **Balances** tab shows:
- Current balance for each player
- Total amounts owed/receivable
- **Minimal Settlement**: The optimal set of transactions to settle all debts

### 6. Session History

View all past sessions in the **History** tab. You can delete sessions if needed (this will reverse the balance changes).

## Example

**Setup:**
- 3 players: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Starting chips: 100 each
- Conversion rate: $0.10 per chip

**Game Results:**
- Alice ends with 150 chips (+50 chips = +$5.00)
- Bob ends with 80 chips (-20 chips = -$2.00)
- Charlie ends with 70 chips (-30 chips = -$3.00)

**Balances After Session:**
- Alice: +$5.00
- Bob: -$2.00
- Charlie: -$3.00

**Minimal Settlement:**
- Bob pays Alice $2.00
- Charlie pays Alice $3.00

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API calls

**Backend:**
- **Node.js** + **Express** - REST API server
- **better-sqlite3** - SQLite database (local file storage)
- **TypeScript** - Type safety across the stack

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in a **SQLite database file**:
- **Location**: `./data/poker-splitwise.db`
- **Tables**: players, game_sessions, settings
- **Persists** across server restarts
- **Independent** from browser - your data is safe!

### Database Schema

- **players** - Player list and cumulative balances
- **game_sessions** - Complete session history with chip configurations
- **settings** - Default chip values and conversion rates

### Documentation

- **[Database Schema](./docs/database_schema.md)** - Complete database structure and table definitions
- **[Database Management](./docs/database_management.md)** - How to query, backup, and manage your data
- **[General Rules](./docs/general_rules.md)** - Game rules and settlement logic

### Database Management

**View database:**
```bash
sqlite3 ./data/poker-splitwise.db
SELECT * FROM players;
```

**Backup:**
```bash
cp ./data/poker-splitwise.db ./data/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

**Reset:**
```bash
rm ./data/poker-splitwise.db
# Database will be recreated on next server start
```
