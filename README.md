# Poker Split Wise

Local-first calculator for home poker nights. React + TypeScript + Vite scaffold with domain types aligned to `docs/general_idea.md`.

## What’s here

- Frontend-only stack (React 18, Vite 5, TypeScript 5).
- Domain types for players, sessions, loans, and settlements in `src/domain`.
- Lightweight UI shell in `src/App.tsx` to outline setup, live session, and settlement flows.
- Base styles and card component ready for further screens.

Setup/run instructions are intentionally omitted for now; we can add them when needed.
